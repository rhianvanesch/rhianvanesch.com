title: Building a browser-based sourdough pet game with Svelte

Back in 2021 I had a sudden burst of nostalgia for [Tamagotchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi). In my misspent youth, I owned a generation 1 Tamagotchi, and now that I code for a living, I thought it might be fun to make one in the browser. Along the way (possibly influenced by pandemic trends) I drifted away from the Tamagotchi idea, and instead decided to make a sourdough pet.

My requirements:

- over time it gets hungry
- feed it to make it grow, once it's hungry enough
- once it's grown enough, you can use it to make a sourdough baked good
- you can unlock different baked goods by baking more

You can probably tell I'm not a game designer, because this isn't a very exciting game. However, I didn't let that stop me.
